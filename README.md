# üß† Palmoria Group HR Data Analysis - Power BI Project Report

### üìà PROJECT OVERVIEW

This report details the development of a Power BI dashboard for the Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company in Nigeria. The objective of this project was to analyze the company's HR data to identify key areas of concern related to gender equality, salary structure, performance, and bonus distribution, and to provide actionable insights for management.

### üîé PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The project encompassed the following key areas:

- Data Extraction and Cleaning: Transforming raw employee data and bonus rules from image formats into structured, usable datasets.

- Data Analysis: Performing comprehensive analysis on gender distribution, salary structures, performance ratings, regulatory compliance (minimum salary), and bonus calculations.

- Data Visualization: Creating a series of interactive visualizations within Power BI to present the analytical findings clearly and concisely.

- Power BI Dashboard Development: Designing and structuring a multi-page Power BI dashboard to facilitate easy exploration and understanding of HR insights.

### üóÇÔ∏èDATA SOURCES:

The primary data sources for this project were:
- Employee Data: Provided as an image (simulating an Excel spreadsheet), containing employee names, gender, department, salary, location, and performance ratings.

- Bonus Rules: Provided as an image, outlining the bonus multipliers applicable to different departments.

### üóÇÔ∏è Data Preparation and Modeling
The dataset has shown the real HR data from Palmora Group and includes the following fields:
Data Cleaning Steps:

1. Gender Imputation: Employees with undisclosed gender were assigned a 'Undisclosed' category to ensure all records were accounted for.

2. Salary Validation: Records with missing or zero salaries were removed, as these indicated employees no longer with the company or invalid data.

3. Department Standardization: 'NULL' values in the department field were removed to maintain data integrity.

### üìà Data Model:

The Power BI data model consists of two main tables:

- EmployeeData: This table contains the cleaned employee information, including calculated fields for individual bonus amounts and total pay inclusive of bonuses. It also includes a Meets_Min_Salary flag and Salary_Band for compliance and distribution analysis.

- BonusRules: This table contains the departmental bonus multipliers.

 A Many-to-One relationship was established between EmployeeData[Department] and BonusRules[Department] to link bonus rules to individual employees.
